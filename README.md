- In this project, we built a Logistic Regression model on Bank 'credit_score' data to predict default customers. First, we upload our train data and start the pre-processing part and then Modelling. There is a Deployment part too. Our model showed a higher Gini coefficient given 58%, hence we will deploy our trained model on new customers 'test_data'.
